# Alternative-Data-Accounting-Research

This repository is my introduction to Github and contains scripts to gather alternative data, compared to the conventional data provider like compustat or crsp. I hope these scripts help (junior) researcher to pursue research questions.

## Edgar Full Text Search Parser

The script helps in extracting 10-K exhibits (e.g. material contracts) from the Edgar database by searching for specific filings via the Edgar Full Text Search [Edgar database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#), parsing the results, and giving back the download links. The download links can be used to download e.g. material contracts from specific filings. There are lots of beautiful existing tutorials to scrape the text. The exhibits can be particularly useful for financial analysts, researchers, and legal professionals.
